# What this series is and is not

.pull-left[
**What it is**:

1. Taking us from planning data collection to cleaning data
2. Best practices to collect data that requires as minimal "cleaning" as possible
3. How to wrangle data into a clean format for sharing with a broad audience.
  - Clear variable names
  - Clear variable labels
  - Clear value labels
  - Accurate values 
  - De-identified
]

.pull-right[
**What it is not**:

1. Writing a data management plan
2. Detailed project planning or assigning of roles
3. Creating Documentation for data sharing
  - Codebooks
  - Project level documentation
4. Data Sharing
  - What, how, where to share data
5. Data Analysis
]

???

You want your data to come to you free of errors and require minimal effort (less recoding, less renaming) 

What this series is not, is everything that happens outside of this data cleaning process

# Disclaimers and Expectations

.pull-left[
Disclaimers:

* There is more to data management
* You may already know some of this
* All use of names or measures are just for demonstration purposes
* Our terminology may be different

Expectations:

* Please ask questions
* Please share your ideas
* A second monitor will be helpful for the R portion

???

* There’s a lot more to data mgmt. 
* But we are specifically focusing on how to clean data in a streamlined and organized way
* A great example is the term data dictionary and codebook. 
* Rectangular variable level file. 
* Experts across the field also use those terms interchangeably.
* I think what is most important is that you choose a term and there is a shared understanding on the team of what that term means.

* Please interact with me

* We can put that process into context of an actual instrument your team collects – and assign roles and responsibilities
* So say this is a process for a teacher survey
* And this is great. Except we all know that this is not a one time thing. This exact process will happen every cycle you collect data.

  - If you don't track until the end, you miss out on the opportunity to discover missing data and the chance to still collect that data
  
  - If you don't clean until the end, you miss the chance to revise any errors in your data collection instruments, and therefore may be creating unusable data
  
  - If you don't clean, you won't be able to access data when you need it. You will need to notify someone of your need and then wait for the data to be prepared.

Don't skip any steps

Instead of just grabbing it from the clean data folder as soon as you need it and being ready to go

# Phases of the data cycle

1. **Documentation**
  - **Style Guide**
  - **Protocol**
  - **Timeline**
  - **ReadMe**
  - **Data Dictionary**

2. Instrument Creation

3. Collecting - not covering this

4. Tracking

5. Capture and Store

6. Writing a data cleaning plan

???

So these phases of the data cycle are what we are covering in this series

There are other types of documentation -especially project level and summary types of data you want to create when you share your data

For now we aren’t focused on that, we are focused on internal documentation that helps us be organized with our process

## Why implement best practices?

1. Makes our work reproducible
  - "Reproducible research is the by-product of careful attention to data management practices throughout the entire lifecycle of a project" - **[A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1801)**, Alston &amp; Rick
  - Replication Crisis that has been going on for over a decade 
      - Ex: A **[2015 study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716)** conducted replications of 100 psychology studies and was only able to replicate 39 of them  
  - Practices that contribute to reproducibility include  
      - Data Dictionary  
      - Style Guide  
      - Protocols
      - Creating a data cleaning plan  
      - Syntax writing  

---

## Why implement best practices?

2\. Creates reliable work
  - Humans are fallible
  - [**The Role of Human Fallibility in Psychological Research: A Survey of Mistakes in Data Management**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459211045930), Kovacs, Hoekstra &amp; Ackzel

.pull-right[
Mistake Types and Their Reported Outcomes
&lt;img src="img/serious_mistake.PNG" width="475px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

???

We make mistakes, and that’s ok

What we are trying to do is minimize those mistakes by learning best practices and implementing good procedures

Authors surveyed 488 researchers who had published in a psychology journal between 2010 and 2018 and had them report on how often they believed they made data mgmt mistakes, what types of mistakes, causes, and the consequences
* Poor project mgmt. and lack of knowledge
* These are not mistakes to take lightly


---

## Why implement best practices?

2\. Creates reliable work - cont.
  - There is an entire blog, **[Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/)**, dedicated to monitoring scientific journal retractions
      - While there are varying reasons to retract an article, unreliable data is a top reason for article retractions
  - Practices that contribute to reliable data include:
      - Keeping one source of truth in participant data tracking
      - Versioning data
      - Validity checks

3\. Keeps data secure
  - Data security is required by both the IRB and funders
  - Incidents where data is not stored properly could lead to lost, destroyed, or unusable data as well as breaches of confidentiality
  - Practices to support data security include:
      - Storing paper and electronic data according to IRB rules
      - De-identifying data
      - Training staff on data security and require data access and use agreements
      - Assigning roles and responsibilities

???

Intentional or unintentional

Can be things like plagiarism or conflicts of interest or the review process was compromised

Retraction Watch has a searchable data

# Documentation

---

## Documentation

.pull-left[

**Why start documentation before a project begins?**

* It is a roadmap for where you are going.
  - What measures are you collecting? Who gets those measures and when?
  - How will we name and code those measures?
  - What are acceptable values?

* Make decisions replicable
  - Hand over documentation to new team members
  
* Helps with recall 
  - What decisions did you make, when, and why
]


.pull-right[

**Why document for internal users?**

* Creates standardization/fidelity
  - Consistent naming and coding across forms and time
  - Consistent processes to gather data
* Helps you discover errors in your data

  - Catch questions you accidentally left off of a survey
  - Catch values out of range
  
* Reduces data rot
  - With so many transformations over time, data becomes unusable if you don't track that information
]

???

I think that is counterintuitive for people. 

I think we tend to think about documenting what HAS happened not what WILL happen. 

But we are trying to change that mindset.

They can pick up where you left off

Damian Conway said: Documentation is a love letter you write to your future self 
-	A year from now, you won’t remember the decisions you made or why you made them

Again we normally think about building documentation for external users to be able to interpret our data

# Directory Structure - File Paths

### Every document has a file path

* 📂 project-new

      + 📄 project-new_codebook_v02.pdf

???

Before we jump into best practices for directory structures, I want to talk about file paths

Which are created from your directory structure

File paths will be a huge part of syntax writing – you will write paths in your syntax to direct your computer to your data

This is called a "relative file path" because it exists in a subdirectory of your home directory

--

In Windows:

* project-new\documentation\project-new_data-dictionary_v05.xlsx
* project-new\documentation\project-new_codebook_v02.pdf

# Directory Structure - File Paths

Your file paths (absolute paths) live within a home directory

* If you are storing files on your computer, your home folder is most likely your username. 
  * **Windows**: C:\Users\username
  * **Mac**: Users/username
  
???

This is called your absolute path because it starts at the root of your directory

For many reasons, not just syntax writing, it's important to think about directory structure in the context of this full file path

It's easy to see that we are working in the Foundations for Success directory (no big deal), but it actually goes deeper than that because that is usually not your highest level directory

It's good to look at this full path because some platforms actually have character limits on how long your path can be. 

So if you are 20 folders deep and your file name is 90 characters long, you could be facing real issues where you are actually unable to open your file

I have a coworker who has had this exact thing happen

It's important to know the term absolute and relative file paths because we will use these terms when we jump into coding in R

--

So the full file path for our previously mentioned data dictionary may be:
  * C:\Users\username\project-new\documentation\project-new_data-dictionary_v05.xlsx  
  
  OR  
  
  * /Users/username/project-new\documentation\project-new_data-dictionary_v05.xlsx

# Style Guide - Directory Structure

--

* Allow you to find files easier
  + Which path is more descriptive?
      - **SG**: W:\project-a\data\cohort-1\student\survey\raw
      - **No SG**: W:\Project-a\data2 New

--

* Allow your computer to find files easier
  + Which path is more machine readable?
      - **SG**: W:\project-a\data\cohort-1\student\survey\raw
      - **No SG**: W:\Project A\Data\Cohort 1\student\Survey.raw

--

* Maintain reproducibility in your data management tasks (consistent file paths)
  + Which file paths maintain reproducibility across time?
      - **SG**: W:\project-a\data\cohort-1\stu\svy **and** W:\project-a\data\cohort-2\stu\svy
      - **No SG**: W:\project-a\data\cohort-1\stu\svy **and** W:\project-a\data\cohort-2\&lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;svy&lt;/span&gt;\&lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;stu&lt;/span&gt;

???

When you write syntax you are going to assume you kept paths the same over time, but that’s not true and now you need to go see what changed

--

* Data security (limiting carte blanche access)
  + Which path is easier to maintain security?
      - **SG**: W:\project-a\data
      - **No SG**: W:\project-a

# Style Guide - Directory Structure - Rules

* Strike a balance between deep and shallow

  + Too shallow leads to many files in one folder
  + Too deep leads to too many clicks and file paths that are too long
  
--

* Create folders that are specific enough to limit access

--

* Folder names should be human readable (meaningful and easy to understand)

--

* Folder names should be machine readable

  + No spaces or punctuation
  + `_` or `-` to separate within and between pieces of metadata

--

* Be consistent with capitalization

--

* Consider the use of an *archive* folder for old versions of files

--

* Don't keep duplicate copies of a document across different locations
  
    + It's too easy to forget to update all copies of a document

??? Can anyone tell me what rules this file path is breaking

---

# Style Guide - Directory Structure - Example

1. All project directories follow this hierarchical metadata structure  
      - Level 1: Name of project  
      - Level 2: Life cycle folders  
      - Level 3: Time period/Data collection wave folders (if relevant)  
      - Level 4: Participant specific folder
      - Level 5: Specific content folder  
      - Level 6: Archive folders  
2. All folders should be named according to these rules  
      - Meaningful name but no longer than 20 characters  
      - No spaces or periods in folder names  
      - Only use lower case letters  
      - Use `-` to separate words  
3. All previous versions of files must be placed into their respective *archive* folder
      - README_changelog.txt placed in each folder to document changes between versions
4. Keep only one copy of a file. Never duplicate a file in multiple locations.

???

Lifecycle folders meaning that cycle we spoke about early (data, documentation, instrument creation, tracking)

# Style Guide - File Naming

* Allow you to locate files easier and prevent errors
  + Which file names are more human readable and ensure you select the most recent document?
      - **SG**: fs_stu_svy-proto_2020-10-01.docx **and** fs_stu_svy-proto_2020-10-22.docx

      - **No SG**: Student survey protocol.1.docx

???

Not only does this one have spaces but it has a dot which causes a lot of confusion because a dot is typically a delimiter between file name and file extension

--

  + Which file names maintain reproducibility across time?
      - **SG**: tch_form_cohort1_time1.xlsx **and** tch_form_cohort1_time2.xlsx

# Style Guide - File Naming - Rules

* Don't use spaces between words

  + They can often break a URL when shared
  
???

And they're just a pain for any command line operations
  
--

* Don't use special characters **except** `-` and `_`
 
  + No `.` `!` `\` `/` `"` `|` `*` `#` `:` `&gt;` `&lt;` `?` `^`
  + They can have meaning within programming languages
  
--

* Don't use file extensions in the name of the file (ex: `renaming_csv_files.xlsx`)

  + Can cause confusion when searching for files

???

We often do this technique called globbing or wildcard expansion where we grab files from your directory based on file extensions

--

* Be intentional with capitalization 

  + Use all lower case, or use capital letters at the start of all new words
  

---

# Style Guide - File Naming - Rules

* Make names descriptive

  + A user should understand the contents without opening the file

--

* Pay attention to the number of characters to prevent hitting your path limit
  + Ex: SharePoint has a path limit of 260 characters
  + This is a real file name created by Qualtrics for a downloaded survey 🤯: `Rural+Center+Montana+Study+(EIS+first)+2020-+Exemplar+Schools_March+19,+2021_07.49.sav`

???

This was saved on a shared network drive we used at the time which had a character limit and we were unable to open the file b/c it hit the character limit (this is 86 characters alone)

--

* Consider keeping redundant metadata in the file name (ex: project name, wave)
  
  + Reduces confusion if you ever move the file
  + Helps make your files searchable

--

* Don't use `\` or `.` in dates. Format dates in one of two sortable ways:
  
  + [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) or [RFC-3339](https://medium.com/easyread/understanding-about-rfc-3339-for-datetime-formatting-in-software-engineering-940aa5d5f68a) format: YYYY-MM-DD
  + YYYYMMDD (this way reduces the number of characters but may be more difficult to read)

---

# Style Guide - File Naming - Rules

* When adding versions, pick a format and stick to it. Consider left padding with 0.
  
  + v01, v02
  
--

* If your files need to be run in sequential order, add the order number to the beginning of the file, again with leading zeros.

  + 01\_ , 02\_, 03\_

--

* Choose abbreviations to use for common names (ex: stu = student)

--

* Pick an order for metadata

  1. Project Name
  2. Time
  3. Participant
  4. Measure
  5. Version
  




&lt;code class ='r hljs remark-code'&gt;"&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;`_`&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;1819&lt;/span&gt;`_`&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;teach&lt;/span&gt;`_`&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;pinfo&lt;/span&gt;`_`&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;v03&lt;/span&gt;.csv"&lt;/code&gt;

---

# Style Guide - File Naming - Example

1. Never use spaces or special characters between words.
1. Use `_` between metadata and `-` to separate words within metadata
1. Use the following metadata file naming order:
    - Order of use (if relevant--and always add a 0 before single digits)
    - Cohort/Wave (if relevant)
    - Participant
    - Measure
    - Further description
    - Date (always add)--Note some schools of thought are to add this as #1 for sortability
    - Version (if necessary--add version with v# and a leading 0)
1. Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD
1. Only use lower case letters
1. Use the following abbreviations
    - student = stu
    - survey = svy
    - cohort = c
    - wave = w
    - protocol = proto

# Style Guide - Versioning

**Some sort of versioning of files is always necessary!**

You have one of two options:

1. Use versioning software/platform (Git, SharePoint, Box, OneDrive)

  + No need to add version or date to your file name (or to your style guide)
  + Every time you save a new copy you can add comments to explain the differences between versions - (only Git)
  + You can go back into your history and restore previous versions

--

2. Create your own manual versioning

  + By adding a date and/or a version number to your documents you can track the most recent versions of documents
      - **I recommend to always manually version your data no matter what**
  + Adding a README to your folders (ex: ReadMe_changelog.txt) where you add comments explaining the updates each time you save a new version

???

You are going to update your data a lot and you are going to want to keep all versions of your data

You might create a file that someone uses and then 3 months later you find an error and create a new updated version

So you want to be able to track who used which version of your data and what the differences were between files

---

# Style Guide - Variable Naming


* Improves interpretation and reduces human error
  + Which variable name is more human readable?
      - **SG**: *s_gender*
      - **No SG**: *q5*

--

* Allows your computer to manipulate variables easier
  + Which variable is more machine readable?
      - **SG**: *toca33*
      - **No SG**: *Family_problems_negatively_affect_this_childs_behavior_in_school*

???

This one doesn’t look bad until you realize most programming languages have a character limit for variable names

--

* Maintain reproducibility in your data management tasks (consistent variable names)
  + Which variable names maintain reproducibility across time?
      - **SG**: &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Time 1&lt;/span&gt;: *toca1* **and** &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Time 2&lt;/span&gt;: *toca1*
      - **No SG**: &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Time 1&lt;/span&gt;: *toca1* **and** &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Time 2&lt;/span&gt;: *toca_1*

--

* Improves data management across projects 
  + Which variable names allow you to combine data across projects?
      - **SG**: &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Project A&lt;/span&gt;: *toca1* **and** &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Project B&lt;/span&gt;: *toca1*
      - **No SG**: &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Project A&lt;/span&gt;: *toca1* **and** &lt;span style="color: blue; "&gt;Project B&lt;/span&gt;: *toca_1*

???

You want your variables to be comparable over time. 

If you change the variable name, no one knows it is the same variable.

# Style Guide - Variable Names - Rules

* Names should be meaningful
  
  + Instead of *q1* use *gender*

  + Most statistical programs have limits (SPSS = 64, Stata = 32, SAS = 32)
  
???

Mplus is something absurd like 8

I don't even talk about that one b/c I like to clean data that is easy to read for the general user and variable names at 8 characters are really difficult to interpret

If you decide to use Mplus to analyze the clean data, you can always rename variables for your analysis file later

--

* If part of a measure, use the scale abbreviation in the name, plus the item number

  + *bmtl01*
  + *bmtl_fctsfirst_sum*

--

* Keep variable names the same across time in a project

  + *bmtl01* in the fall and *bmtl01* again in the spring

--

* Keep variable names the same across projects

  + Some people would like to keep variable names the same across the field
  
---

# Style Guide - Variable Names - Rules

* Don't use spaces or special characters (except `_`)
  
    + Even "-" is not allowed in most programs as it can be mistaken for minus sign

--

* Be consistent with delimiters and capitalization

  + Pascal case (*ScaleSum*)
  + Snake case (*scale_sum*)
  + Camel case (*scaleSum*)
  + Kebab case (*scale-sum*)--don't use this for variable names
  + Train case (*Scale-Sum*)--don't use this for variable names

--

* Don't start a variable name with a number

  + Most statistical programs won't even allow this


---

# Style Guide - Variable Names - Rules

* Don't name variables any keywords or functions in programming languages

  + Ex: *if*, *for*, *repeat* - R
  + Ex: *or*, *with*, *to* - SPSS
  
--

* All variable names in a study should be unique 

  + *d_gender* = student gender reported by the district
  + *s_gender* = student gender self-reported
  + *t_gender* = teacher gender self-reported
  
--

* Denote reverse coding in the variable name
  
  + *scale01* and *scale01_r*

---

# Style Guide - Variable Names - Rules


* Choose abbreviations to use for common scale names and phrases

  + scaled score = ss
  + percentil rank = pr
  + woodcock johnson test of cognitivie abilities = wj
  
--

* Track different versions of variables

  + If a question wording significantly changes or response options change for a variable mid-project after you've collected data, version that variable
  + Ex: revised *scale1* becomes *scale1_v02*

--

* Consider including an indication of the instrument in your variable name

  + Ex: s = student self-survey, r = teacher rating of student, t = teacher self-survey
  + *s_anxiety01* and *r_toca01*
  + This also helps make your variable names unique (ex: t_gender, s_gender)
  
---

# Style Guide - Variable Names - Time

If your data is longitudinal, you need to consider time in your variable naming

Depending on how you plan to merge your data, there are 2 ways to account for time:

1. **Concatenate time to your variables.**

  + You do this if you plan to merge your data in wide format
  + Every participant has one row of data
  + For example for 3 waves of scale1 on the student self-survey
      + *s_w1_bmtl01*, *s_w2_bmtl01*, *s_w3_bmtl01*
  + If you are collecting cohorts, you may still want *cohort* added as a separate variable

--

2. **Create time variables and add them to your data.**

  + You do this if you plan to append your data in long format.
  + Every participant occurs in your data more than once for each wave of data collection.
  + Ex: Add a *cohort* variable and a *wave* variable to your data and *s_bmtl01* stays the same variable name for every wave of data collection

# Style Guide - Variable Names

You do not need to decide any of this right away:

  * How you want to merge your data
  * How you want to account for time
  * How you want to account for the survey instrument

--

As you collect data, account for all relevant metadata in your file name:

  * `c1_w1_stu_svy_clean-data_2021-01-10.sav`
  * Because of my style guide, I know this file is cohort 1, wave 1, student, self-report survey
  * When I go to finally merge my data, I can make my decisions then about how to account for time
  * It's very easy to add these variables or append this information to existing variables at any point

--

&lt;br&gt;

If you choose to merge in a long format and later want your data in wide format, it is very easy to switch back and forth between long and wide format in statistical programs. Don't worry!

Whatever you finally decide on, document your rule in your **style guide**

# Style Guide - Value Coding - Rules

* Keep values consistent within identical variables across time

  + **Do**: Use 1 = yes, 0 = no for *stress02* in wave 1, and 1 = yes, 0 = no for wave 2
      + **Don't**: Use 1 = yes, 0 = no for *stress02* in wave 1, and 1 = no, 2 = yes for wave 2
  
--

* Keep values consistent across the project
  
  + **Do**: Always use 1=yes; 0=no
      + **Don't**: For some variables use 2=yes; 1=no, for other variables 1=yes; 0=no
  + **Do**: Always use m=male, f=female, n=non-binary
      + **Don't**: Switch between 'M', 'm', and 'male' to denote male
    
--

* Make sure scale response option ordering makes sense

  + **Do**: Strongly Disagree = 1; Disagree = 2; Agree =3; Strongly Agree = 4
      + **Don't**: Strongly Disagree = 1; Disagree = 3; Agree = 4; Strongly Agree = 2
    
---

# Style Guide - Value Coding - Rules

* Define missing values

  + You can decide to leave all missing values as NA or NULL
  + Or you can assign missing values based on their properties
      - Use extreme values that do not actually occur in your data
      - Do not use character values in numeric fields

# Protocols

*Also called Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are document/s to record all your procedures as well as changes made to those procedures throughout the grant.*

Purpose:

* For you to document every decision you make so that over time you both **remember what you did and why** as well as **implement your procedures with fidelity**.

* To document roles and responsibilities for each procedure

.pull-left[
* Have one protocol for each piece of data that you collect, and include steps from instrument creation all the way through data capture
  - Qualtrics Teacher Survey
  - Paper Student Assessment
  - District Data
  - Classroom Observations
]

.pull-right[
* Have protocols for data cleaning processes
  - Rules for dealing with duplicate surveys
  - How to lay out a syntax file
]

**Can be created in Word, PDF, txt, Markdown**

???

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion language
  
---

# Protocols

The protcol can either be one large document, with a table of contents, or stand alone documents.

Each protocol should *begin* with:

* Title
* Date the protocol was made   
* Who made the protocol  
* Purpose of the protocol  
* Any related documents or research behind this protocol  

**Then write up the details about the procedure/protocol.**

--

For any *changes* to the protocol after the project has begun add the following below the original protocol section:  
 * Revision date  
 * Who decided on the revision  
 * Any rationale behind the revision  
 * Any related documents or research behind the revision

# ReadMe

*A plain text document that contains information about your files. May also be seen written as README.*

They are most known for their use in computer science, but have become more prevalent in research. 

Can serve many purposes:
- Descriptive information about the purpose and organization of a dataset
- Information about a set of files in a directory
- **Changelog of differences between versions of a file**
- Steps and/or files in a process
- Data cleaning plan

&lt;br&gt;

**Can be in many formats including txt, PDF, Word, Markdown, Excel**

# ReadMe - Changelog

&lt;img src="img/changelog.PNG" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.footnote[Source: [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/changelog)]

???

If I was going to say what one of THE most important pieces of documentation for a data manager is, it's this document

In addition to the data dictionary which we will discuss next

The reason is, every time you think you are done cleaning the data, you are wrong

1. Someone will find something wrong or missing in the raw data
2. Someone will decide that they want to code or name a variable a different way than you already have in your clean data
3. Someone will find an error in your clean data caused by a coding mistake

You will ultimately have multiple versions of a file

And that's fine if you never put that data out in the world, because no one has used the data. But a lot of times, these things come up 1, 2, 6 months, 2 years after you have given this data to other people.

And people have one version of your data, and you will now have this new version, and you will want to keep track of the differences.

Because at some point, someone is going to ask you, why is my data different than your data.

And this is going to save you. Because you will not remember. This is what contributes to the reproducibility of your work.

# Data Dictionary

*A rectangular format collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project. Some may refer to this as a codebook.*

Purpose:
* Provides a roadmap for instrument creation
  - Tells you how to name variables and code values in an instrument like Qualtrics
* Enforces data standards
* Creates consistency across the members of the team and across the project over time
* Can be integrated into data cleaning
  - Renaming, labeling, calculations
* Assists in data validation
  - Checking columns, types, and ranges
* Communicates the contents of dataset
  - Do we have everything we should in our data, based on our data dictionary


**Can be created in Excel or other rectangular formats**

# Data Dictionary - Elements

.pull-left[

* Variable Name

* Variable Label

* Associated scale/measure
  + Group your variables by scale/measure

* Associated form (Student survey, teacher rating of student)

* Value range or value codes ([1-99] or 0=No, 1=Yes)

* Measurement unit (numeric, string, date, etc.)
]

.pull-right[

* Missing data codes

* Variable universe (Who gets this question? Is there skip logic?)

* What time periods does this variable exist

* Reverse coding

* Calculations (composite variables, scores)
* Notes (such as versions/changes to this variable)

* Order number of the question on the form
]

---

# Data Dictionary 

In order to start a data dictionary, you should gather the following information:

- What measures are we collecting? (Ex: Student Assessment, Teacher Observation, Teacher Survey, Principal Interview)
- What are the items/scales included?
  + Get a copy of the original measure and make sure the question wording is accurate. Make sure the subscale you've assigned the question to is accurate
- What is your variable naming protocol? (Check your style guide)
- Do your items/scales have pre-determined value coding rules or can we assign our own? What is our value coding protocol? (Check your style guide)

--

It’s good to also consider starting to document the variables you aren’t collecting but you are assigning or deriving.

- Cohort/Group
- Time period
- Treatment
- Variables do you plan to derive (ex: mean scores, collapsed categorical variables)

---

# Data Dictionary - Example

1. Used student work to plan for mathematics instruction 
2. Examined your teaching materials/assignments in relation to the Math standards

&lt;br&gt;

|measure|scale|var_name|label|type|values|recode|
|------|--------|--------|-----|----|------|------|
|cip|?|?| Used student work to plan for mathematics instruction | ? | ?| ? |
|cip|?| ?| Examined your teaching materials/assignments in relation to the Math standards | ? |?| ?|

???

Example of the process you might go through to create a data dictionary

This is just for one instrument. Say a teacher survey.

Say Rob sends you 2 questions he wants to add to the survey. They're from the CIP measure.

I'm going to go ahead and add some columns to my data dictionary and add info

What I am going to do next is either ask Rob for or start googling for the cip measure

---

&lt;img src="img/cip_measure.PNG" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

I see two things I want to ask about

1. The question wording isn't identical
2. There are more questions than just those 2 for this scale

---

# Data Dictionary - Example

|measure|scale|var_name|label|type|values|recode|
|------|--------|--------|-----|----|------|------|
|cip|Individual Teacher Instructional Practices|CIP_StudWork| Used student work to plan for mathematics instruction | ? | ?| ? |
|cip|Individual Teacher Instructional Practices|CIP_TeachMath| Examined your teaching materials/assignments in relation to the Math standards | ? |?| ?|
|cip|Individual Teacher Instructional Practices| CIP_Pace | Used the pacing guides to plan for mathematics instruction | ? | ? | ? |

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

# Data Dictionary - Example

|measure|subscale|var_name|label|type|values|recode|
|------|--------|--------|-----|----|------|------|
|cip|Individual Teacher Instructional Practices| CIP_StudWork| Used student work to plan for mathematics instruction | numeric | 1 = Never, 2 = Less than once a month, 3 = 2 or 3 times a month, 4 = Once or twice a week, 5 = Daily | NA |
|cip|Individual Teacher Instructional Practices| CIP_TeachMat | Examined your teaching materials/assignments in relation to the Math | numeric | 1 = Never, 2 = Less than once a month, 3 = 2 or 3 times a month, 4 = Once or twice a week, 5 = Daily | NA|
|cip|Individual Teacher Instructional Practices| CIP_Pace | Used the pacing guides to plan for mathematics instruction | numeric  | 1 = Never, 2 = Less than once a month, 3 = 2 or 3 times a month, 4 = Once or twice a week, 5 = Daily  | NA |

???

And now I have a data dictionary

There are still several columns I might want to add such as universe, skip logic, etc

# Data Dictionary - Survey Complete

???

A data dictionary can be built for existing tools as well. 

So maybe a survey was collected before anyone ever built a data dictionary. That’s okay. 

Build it after you download it. 

Now instead of being a roadmap for how you will build the survey, it will be a roadmap for how you will clean it. 

It’s less ideal, but it still helps.

# Data Dictionary - Extant Data

???

Data dictionaries aren’t just for surveys. 

Build them for all data you are going to collect. Observations, forms, assessments, etc.

Same thing goes for outside data (district data), which may not come with its own codebook/data dictionary. 

You will need to build your own. 

This may take a lot of effort on your part to work with the owner to learn what data codes mean, etc.

But everything you learn, you add to the data dictionary.

# Comparison to Codebook

*Contains information intended to be complete and self-explanatory for each variable in a data file, such as the wording and coding of the item, and the underlying construct - [FORRT](https://forrt.org/glossary/codebook/)*

.pull-left[
Purpose:
  * Without ever having to open the data file, a user can see summary statistics about the data and make decisions based on that information.
  
**Can be created in txt, PDF, Word, Markdown**
